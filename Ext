In Agile development, GitHub Pull Requests (PRs) are a key part of the collaborative workflow. When a developer completes a feature or bug fix on a separate branch, they create a Pull Request to merge their changes into the main branch (e.g., develop or main). The PR acts as a formal request for review, allowing teammates to discuss the code, suggest improvements, and ensure that the work aligns with sprint goals and coding standards. This method promotes transparency, peer review, and continuous integration, which are core principles of Agile. Once approved and tested, the PR is merged, keeping the project stable and aligned with ongoing iterations.
